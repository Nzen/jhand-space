### Gluten Free Chocolate Chip Cookies

I've been experimenting with gluten free chocolate chip cookies, based on my [perfect cookie recipe](/cookies). There is a lot to learn, but the main struggles so far are making sure the cookies stay together and are not too dry. To start, I've been using Bob's Red Mill all purpose gluten free flour, which is a good all purpose gf flour!

A few tips so far:

* Much easier to make small cookies. They stay together better and seem to keep more moisture.
* They go very quickly from done to too try, you need to watch closely and take them out before they look ready. Then give them some time to cook on the hot sheet.
* I usually use butter directly on the cookie pan, but the cookies seemed to be spreading too much. Using parchment paper has helped to avoid too much spread.
* 24-48hrs in fridge helps a lot!
* Ghee! I tried using ghee instead of butter out of curiosity. The cookies were a lot more moist and pretty great. You wouldn't know they were gluten free. I was worried the ghee taste would come through too much but it was a nice mellow nutty flavor.

The last batch was pretty great, I may continue to experiment with different flours but quite happy with where I am:

* 325g Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1-for-1 all purpose
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 3/4 cup ghee
* 1 egg + 1 egg yolk
* 1 tbsp vanilla
* chocolate chips

Bake at 325 for ~11 minutes. Cool on sheet for 5 minutes, then move to wire rack.

Enjoy!
