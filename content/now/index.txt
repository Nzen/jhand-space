<span class="f7 avenir">*(This is my now page, letting you know what I am doing now. [The idea](http://nownownow.com/about) was inspired by Derek Sivers.)*</span>

I am flying on a plane to New York City! Code for Science and Society is part of the Open Source Alliance for Open Scholarship. We helped organize a handbook hackathon this week, bringing together people to write stuff. Preparing for the decentralized web summit.



Other random things:

* Using the [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) this year! Mine is pretty minimal, but did spend some time making spaces to track some habits and other things. I'm liking it so far, but there are periods where I am miss updating it for a few days or a week, especially with travel. I'd still like to make it a bit more habitual.
*

Lots of reading lately! I am aiming for 55 books this year. Last year I set my goal for 60 but got bogged down in some super long books and read about 45. I have quite a few half finished books, so I have a head start!
