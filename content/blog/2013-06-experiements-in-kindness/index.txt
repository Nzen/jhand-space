On June 29th 2011, one week and one day after turning 24, I set out on a mission. The mission: make some yummy chocolate chip cookies. Something about [making chocolate chip cookies](/cookies/) always strikes the right notes with me. When I bake my soul is at ease. Me and the cookies are one. I am not sure what it is; part science, part chocolate, lots of sugar, and of course, smiles. People love cookies and I love making people smile.

After I had lots of cookies, I needed someone to eat them. Deciding to give them to cyclists heading home from work was the easy part. The real inspiration struck me while reading about the ongoing conflict in Ladd's Circle. And so my first Experiment in Kindness was born. You can see [the lab notes here](https://github.com/joehand/smilingjoe/blob/gh-pages/experiments/_posts/2011-06-30-freecookies.markdown).

The response of the complete strangers receiving cookies amazed me. I cannot remember a better bike ride than the one returning home after that experience. It did not take long for me to launch [smilingjoe.com](http://smilingjoe.com) and make it a goal to keep my experiments going. The experiment was also featured [on the local bike blog](https://bikeportland.org/2011/07/01/solution-for-ladd-circle-stop-sign-issue-cookies-55819), BikePortland.

Kindness begets kindness. We can each make the world a better place with kindnesses small or large. Even if my experiments fail or stop completely, I know that for that one day, in those 30 minutes, I put smiles on 100 faces and that is enough.

> The day always looks brighter from behind a smile.
