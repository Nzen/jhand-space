## License Zero

*Gainful software in the open*

### Why I like License Zero

* Make expectations around commercial use transparent.


### Problems

* Assumption that you can use open source work
* Disconnect between developers and legal teams in commercial companies
* Downstream users (not using the immediate package)


## Systemic Problems

* We are trying to solve it from the abused party, not going to work.
* Needs culture change within institutions using open source (especially academic institutions)
