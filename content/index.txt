Hello! I am Joe, a purveyor of mediocre Hand-related jokes. I work at the intersection of communities and technology to address structural problems. Currently, I am Director of Operations and co-Executive Director of <a href="https://codeforscience.org" class="washed-red fw5 link dim">Code for Science & Society</a> and a core developer on <a href="https://datproject.org" class="washed-red fw5 link dim">Dat Project</a>. I nerd out about maps, social systems, open data, and books.

Find out what I am doing <a href="/now/" class="washed-red fw5 link dim">now</a>. Have a sweet tooth? Learn how to make the <a href="/cookies/" class="washed-red fw5 link dim">best cookies</a> in the world. Support public data, <a href="http://donate.datproject.org" target="_blank" class="washed-red fw5 link dim">donate</a> to Dat Project.
